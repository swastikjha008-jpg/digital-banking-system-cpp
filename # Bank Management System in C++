# 🏦 Digital Banking System (C++)

A simple console-based **Banking System** built in **C++**, designed to simulate basic banking operations.  
It lets users check balance, deposit or withdraw money, and keeps a transaction record — all inside a clean menu-driven interface.  

This project also includes a **PIN login system** for added security and a **transaction history file** that logs every deposit and withdrawal with a timestamp.
